Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    global number a = 0;
    duff {
        my (a) {
            a = a + 1;
        }
    }

    number b = 0;
    duff {
        my (b) {                    Marge: This should give an error;
            b = 1;                  Marge: This should give an error;
        }
    }

    duff {
        number c = 0;
        my (c) {                    Marge: This should give an error;
            c = c + 1;
        }
    }

    duff {
        global number d = 0;
        my (d) {
            d = d + 1;
        }
    }

    global number e;
    duff {
        my (e) {
            e = e + 1;
        }
    }

    duff {
        my (f) {                    Marge: This should give an error;

        }
    }


} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
