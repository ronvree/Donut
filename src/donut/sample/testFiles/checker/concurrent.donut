Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number x = 1;
    duff {
        number x = 2;
    }

    global number y = 1;
    duff {
        y = 1;
    }

    global number z = 1;
    duff {
        number z = 1;           Marge: This should give an error;
    }

    global number a = 0;
    duff {
        a = a + 1;
    }
    a = a + 1;

    number b = 1;
    duff {
        b = 2;                  Marge: This should give an error;
    }

    duff {
        global reaction r = WOOHOO;
    }

    duff {
        r = D'OH;               Marge: This should give an error;
    }

} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
