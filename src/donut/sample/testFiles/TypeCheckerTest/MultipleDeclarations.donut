Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    number a = 3;
    number b;

    (WOOHOO) eh? {
        b = 5;
    } nope {
        number a = 2;           Marge: wrong, a already used in parent scope;
    }


    (D'OH) eh? {
        number c;               Marge: correct, not used in parent scope;
    } nope {
        number c;               Marge: correct, not used in parent scope;
    }



} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
