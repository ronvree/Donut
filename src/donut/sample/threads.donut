Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    Marge: Your code goes here ;

    global number a = 100;
    global number b = 1;



    duff { Marge: code for thread;
        b = b + a;
    }

    number d;

    b = b + 100;

    duff {
        a = 90;
        b = b + 30;
    }

    b = b + 99;

} I hope I didn't brain my damage.
