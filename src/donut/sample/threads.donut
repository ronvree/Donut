Alright brain... it's all up to you {

    Marge: Your code goes here ;

    number a = 3;
    global number b = 1;



    duff { Marge: code for thread;
        number a = 43;
        b = b + a;
    }

    number d;
    number e;
    d = d + 1;
    e = d + e;
    e = d + 1;

    duff {
        number a = 90;
        b = b + 1;
    }

    number f;
    number g;
