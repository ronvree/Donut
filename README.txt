DONUT
by Ron van Bree & Gijs Beernink

How to run:
- Create a new project in IntelliJ or eclipse and import from existing sources the unpacked zip-file.
- Add JUnit4 to classpath if necessary.
- Run DonutTest.java, which is located in the test package, to test the whole system including grammar, checker and generator.
- Run petersonTest.java to test Peterson's algorithm. This is kept in a separate test because it needs 2 threads instead of the usual 3.





To test own donut samples:

- Change the sandbox.donut file to your wishes! See src/donut/testfiles/sandbox.donut
- Run Sandbox.java, located in test/donut


ENJOY!
